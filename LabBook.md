Started to read "The C++ Programming Language", 4th Edition [Bjarne Stroustrup].  This is the third time I've read the book.  This version covers C++11, the first major revision since 98.

Blogged on the subjcet of cleaning up Git repository after a failed commit due to large files size.

Investigated the presence of ANN in SpectralAnalysis.  I have build the library but it is not integrated with the DiffusionMaps package. Mauro relayed to me that the CoverTree implementation had a bug and that is was fixed by one of his students. I am not sure if I have that version or not. 

Built a OpenMP version of SuperLU and blogged about the changes. It is not clear whether this is the best sparse solver. Other choices for a sparse linear solver are UMFPACK and MKL PARDISO. 

Read Chapter 2 "The C++ Programming Language", 4th Edition [Bjarne Stroustrup]. 

Installed Visual Studio 2013 to test new C++11 language features.

Started to write The Beginners Guide To The Bushido Software Development Methodology.

Reorganized all the libraries in the KL source tree.  Cleaned up the organization of code to model best practices for code organization. 

Blogged on the distribution of binaries dependencies of GitHub repositories.  

Blogged on the subject of Intel Compiler crippling performance when running on AMD hardware.  Noted that there are CPUID manipulation routines out there.

I've been thinking about writing pracices and word wrapping. Do I want to introduce hard breaks in my writing? GitHub does not word wrap txt. Most modern editors do.  I'm wondering if GitHub will diplay wrapping if I change the extension of my test files to md.  Update : GitHub wrapps.  There is a default line width of 120 characters. The source window or editor wrapped after 120 characters. The window can not be scaled below 120 characters without a scrollbar being introduces.
