The ubiquity of software has led to an explosion of development methodologies and paradigms. Few take into account the social aspects of designing, implementing, testing, and delivering quality software products.  Software is written in many contexts by individuals with a wide spectrum of dispositions. Gone are the days when software was written primarily by bearded Unix sytem programmers.

I've been lucky in my career to have started programming in Basic and Fortran 77 with punch cards when I was 14 and participated in the revolution of personal computing that took place in the 80's and 90's.  Back then we were coders. Coders coded. My interests were in graphics, science, and occasionally bringing down the high school mainframe when report cards were due. It was not until the late 90's that I made my way into the software engineering community as a professional.  I have been a professional software engineer since 1997 in a wide variety of settings.  

I've witnessed many successes, and failures over the years both in the professional developmment of my peers and and in products we shipped.  Conflict, competition for resources, chrologogical contraints, and histrionics occasionally go along with the brilliance, hard work, passion, and perseverence of successful and failed projects.  When the end of a project is near one is led to reflect.  Retropsectives are vital to good software engineering. This is when we learn, grow, and improve our technical skills.  

I like analogies when describing processes and forces of development to non engineers.  This work has come out of my most recent retrospective.  It's an attempt to document some of my Zen practices I bring to my software projects.  This work is serious and it is not.  Reflect on that.   

Bushido originates from samurai moral code. The cannons of frugality, loyalty, martial arts mastery, and honor. Bushido was also influenced by Shinto and Zen Buddhism.  I have always been somewhat of an ascetic when it comes to my life and particularly to my pratice of science and engineering.  There are many parallels to Bushido I see in the way I navigate the business climate and practice development of quality software systems. This work is serious yet it is not. This work is creative and it is not.  Such is the nature of science and engineering.

---------------------
The code should do only and exactly what it is intended to do.
The code should be fast.  This is the way. 
The code should be readable by all. This is the way. 
The code should be tested. The code shall be commented. 
The code should follow a style guide. The code shall be kept safe in source control. This is Zen. 

The end product does not matter.
The customer don't matter.
The success of the product does not matter.
The code alone matters.
Be true to the code for there is nothing else. 

Reflect upon this.

Miyamoto Musashi 
Dokkodo "The Path of Aloneness"
Accept everything just the way it is.
Do not seek pleasure for its own sake.
Do not, under any circumstances, depend on a partial feeling.
Think lightly of yourself and deeply of the world.
Be detached from desire your whole life.
Do not regret what you have done.
Never be jealous.
Never let yourself be saddened by a separation.
Resentment and complaint are appropriate neither for oneself nor others.
Do not let yourself be guided by the feeling of lust or love.
In all things, have no preferences.
Be indifferent to where you live.
Do not pursue the taste of good food.
Do not hold on to possessions you no longer need.
Do not act following customary beliefs.
Do not collect weapons or practice with weapons beyond what is useful.
Do not fear death.
Do not seek to possess either goods or fiefs for your old age.
Respect Buddha and the gods without counting on their help.
You may abandon your own body but you must preserve your honor.
Never stray from the way.

The Way of the code is the moral teaching of the software engineer. This is fostered by Zen philosophy which shapes the skillful practice of the engineer. In Zen there are no elaborations. Zen is the investigation of the true nature of things. There are no ceremonies, no teachings, the benefits of Zen are poersonal.  Enlightenment in Zen does not mean a change in behaviour, but realisation of the nature
of ordinary life.  The end point is the beginning. The great virtue of Zen is simplicity. 
It is Zen to treat your enemy as an honoured guest. It is Zen to throw away fear.  The first technique is the last, the beginner and the master behave in the same way. Knowledge is a full circle.  This is Zen. 

----------------------------
Use a code printer.  Print and read thy code. Use line numbers when printing code. This is Zen. Some would argue not to waste treess printing code on paper.  They would be right and they would be wrong. 
----------------------------

Move in and out of positions like a ghost. As if you were not there. That is what good help is supposed to be.  Leave behind good code. Your reputation will follow you if you adhere to this principle. Fear not the reference puzzle.  Let your code speak for you. That is the Way.  Ponder This.

If a sunk pukes on your code dig a whole and but a bot in it.
