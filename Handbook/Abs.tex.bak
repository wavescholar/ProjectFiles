This work is a field guide for Machine Learning, and Numerical Linear Algebra. By field guide we mean a book intended to help guide the reader while actively engaged in algorithm development.  These pages have variously served as my personal notes and software capability demonstrations. It is the authors hope that the will be useful or interesting to mathematicians making the transition from theory to application.
