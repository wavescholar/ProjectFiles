This work is a field guide for Machine Learning, and Numerical Linear Algebra. By field guide we mean a book intended to help guide software engineers actively engaged in algorithm development.  These pages have variously served as my personal notes and software capability demonstrations.  A certain amount of mathematical sophistication is assumed at points.
