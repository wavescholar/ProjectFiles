I have been many years training in the Way^ of strategy/ called Ni Ten Ichi Ryu, and now
I think I will explain it in writing for the first time. It is now during the first ten days of the
tenth month in the twentieth year of Kanei (1645). I have climbed mountain Iwato of Higo
in Kyushu to pay homage to heaven," pray to Kwannon,"* and kneel before Buddha. I am a
warrior of Harima province, Shinmen Musashi No Kami Fujiwara No Geshin, age sixty
years.

From youth my heart has been inclined toward the Way of strategy. My first duel
was when I was thirteen, I struck down a strategist of the Shinto school, one Arima Kihei.^
When I was sixteen I struck down an able strategist, Tadashima Akiyama. When I was
twenty-one I went up to the capital and met all manner of strategists, never once failing to
win in many contests.

After that I went from province to province duelling with strategists of various
schools, and not once failed to win even though I had as many as sixty encounters. This
was between the ages of thirteen and twenty-eight or twenty-nine.

When I reached thirty I looked back on my past. The previous victories were not
due to my having mastered strategy. Perhaps it was natural ability, or the order of heaven,
or that other schools' strategy was inferior. After that I studied morning and evening
searching for the principle, and came to realise the Way of strategy when I was fifty.

Since then I have lived without following any particular Way. Thus with the virtue of
strategy I practise many arts and abilities� all things with no teacher.' To write this book I
did not use the law of Buddha or the teachings of Confucius, neither old war chronicles
nor books on martial tactics. I take up my brush to explain the true spirit' of this Ichi school



1 l/l/ay: The Character for Way is read "Michi" in Japanese or "Do" in Chinese-based reading. It is equivalent to the
Chinese "Tao" and means the whole life of the warrior, his devotion to the sword, his place in the Confucius-coloured
bureaucracy of the Tokugawa system. It is the road of the cosmos, not just a set of ethics for the artist or priest to live by,
but the divine footprints of God pointing the Way.

2 Strategy: "Heiho" is a word of Chinese derivation meaning military strategy. "Hei" means soldier and "Ho" means
method or form.

3 Homage to heaven: "Ten" or heaven means the Shinto religion, Shinto � a word compounding the two characters
"Kami" (God) and "Michi" (Way"-is the old religion of Japan. In Shinto there are many Holies, gods of steel and
fermentation, place and industry, and so-on, and the first gods, ancestors to the Imperial line.

'^ Kwannon: God(dess) of mercy in Buddhism.

^ Arima Kihei: of the Shinto school. See note 15.

^ All things with no teacher: There had been traditions instituted for the arts in the Muromachi period, system of grades

and licenses and seniority, and these were perpetuated perhaps more rigidly under the Tokugawa bureaucracy. Musashi

studied various arts in various schools, but when after his enlightenment he pursued his studies he had become separate

from traditional guidance. He writes his final words in the book of the Void: "Then you will come to think of things in a

wide sense, and taking the Void as the Way, you will see the Way as Void."

' Spirit "Shin" or "Kokoro" has been translated "heart", "soul", or "spirit". It could be put as feeling, manner. It has always

been said "The sword is the soul of the samurai."



as it is mirrored in the Way of heaven and Kwannon. The time is the night of the tenth day
of the tenth month, at the hour of the tiger*^ (3-5 a.m.)



'The hour of the fi'ger: Years, months and hours were named after the ancient Chinese Zodiacal time system.



TheGround Book



Stategy is the craft of the warrior. Commanders must enact the craft, and troopers should
know this Way. There is no warrior in the world today who really understands the Way of
strategy.

There are various Ways. There is the Way of Salvation by the law of Buddha, the
Way of Confucius governing the Way of learning, the Way of healing as a doctor, as a
poet teaching the Way of Waka,^ tea,'� archery," and many arts and skills. Each man
practices as he feels inclined.

It is said the warrior's is the twofold Way of pen and sword,' ^ and he should have a
taste for both Ways. Even if a man has no natural ability he can be a warrior by sticking
assiduously to both divisions of the Way. Generally speaking, the Way of the warrior is
resolute acceptance of death.'" Although not only warriors but priests, women, peasants



5 Waka: The thirty-one syllable poem. The word means "Song of Japan" or "Song in Harmony".

" Tea: Tea drinking is studied in schools, just like sword-fencing. It is basically a ritual, based on simple refined rules,

between a few persons in a small room.

1^ Archery: The bow was the main weapon of the samurai of the Nara and Heian periods, and was later superseded by

the sword. Archery is practised as a ritual like tea and sword. Hachiman, the God of War, is often depicted as an archer,

and the bow is frequently illustrated as part of the paraphernalia of the gods.

12 Pen and sword: "Bunbu Itchi" or "Pen and sword in accord" is often presented in brushed calligraphy. Young men
during the Tokugawa period were educated solely in writing the Chinese classics and exercising in swordplay. Pen and
sword, in fact, filled the life of the Japanese nobility.

13 Resolute acceptance of death: This idea can be summed up as the philosophy expounded in Ha Gakure or "Hidden
Leaves", a book written in the seventeenth century by Yamamoto Tsunenori and a few other samurai of the province
Nabeshima Han, present-day Saga. Under the Tokugawas, the enforced logic of the Confucius-influenced system
ensured stability among the samurai, but it also meant the passing of certain aspects of Bushido. Discipline for both
samurai and commoners became lax. Yamamoto Tsunenori had been counsellor to Mitsushige, lord of Nabeshima Han,
for many years, and upon his lord's death he wanted to commit suicide with his family in the traditional manner. This kind
of suicide was strictly prohibited by the new legislation, and, full of remorse, Yamamoto retired in sadness to the
boundary of Nabeshima Han. Here he met others who had faced the same predicament, and together they wrote a
lament of what they saw as the decadence of Bushido. Their criticism is a revealing comment on the changing face of
Japan during Musashi's lifetime: "There is no way to describe what a warrior should do other than he should adhere to
the Way of the warrior (Bushido). I find that all men are negligent of this. There are a few men who can quickly reply to
the question "What is the Way of the Warrior?" This is because they do not know in their hearts. From this we can say
they do not follow the Way of the warrior. By the Way of the warrior is meant death. The Way of the warrior is death. This
means choosing death whenever there is a choice between life and death. It means nothing more than this. It means to
see things through, being resolved. Sayings like "To die with your intention unrealized is to die uselessly", and so on, are
from the weak Kyoto, Osaka Bushido. They are unresolved as to whether to keep to their original plan when faced with
the choice of life and death. Every man wants to live. They theorize with staying alive in mind. "The man who lives on
when he had failed in his intention is a coward" is a heartless definition. That to die having failed is to die uselessly is a
mad point of view. This is not a shameful thing. It is the most important thing in the Way of the warrior. If you keep your
spirit correct from morning to night, accustomed to the idea of death and resolved on death, and consider yourself as a
dead body, thus becoming one with the Way of the warrior, you can pass through life with no possibility of failure and



and lowlier folk have been known to die readily in the cause of duty or out of shame, this
is a different thing. The warrior is different in that studying the Way of strategy is based on
overcoming men. By victory gained in crossing swords with individuals, or enjoining battle
with large numbers, we can attain power and fame for ourselves or for our lord.^^ This is
the virtue of strategy.



The Way of Strategy

In China and Japan practitioners of the Way have been known as "masters of strategy".
Warriors must learn this Way.

Recently there have been people getting on in the world as strategists, but they
are usually just sword-fencers. The attendants of the Kashima Kantori shrines'" of the
province Hitachi received instruction from the gods, and made schools based on this
teaching, travelling from country to country instructing men. This is the recent meaning of
strategy.

In olden times strategy was listed among the Ten Abilities and Seven Arts as a
beneficial practice. It was certainly an art but as beneficial practice it was not limited to
sword-fencing. The true value of sword-fencing cannot be seen within the confines of
sword-fencing technique.

If we look at the world we see arts for sale. Men use equipment to sell their own
selves. As if with the nut and the flower, the nut has become less than the flower. In this
kind of Way of strategy, both those teaching and those learning the way are concerned
with colouring and showing off their technique, trying to hasten the bloom of the flower.
They speak of "This Dojo" and "That Dojo".'" They are looking for profit. Someone once
said "Immature strategy is the cause of grief". That was a true saying.



perform your office properly.

"The servant must think earnestly of the business of his employer. Such a fellow is a spendid retainer. In this house there

have been generations of splendid gentlemen and we are deeply impressed by their warm kindness ... all our ancestors.

This was simply abondoning body and soul for the sake of their lord.

"Moreover, our house excels in wisdom and technical skill. What a joyful thing if this can be used to advantage.

"Even an unadaptable man who is completely useless is a most trusted retainer if he does nothing more than think

earnestly of his lord's welfare. To think only of the practical benefit of wisdom and technology is vulgar.

"Some men are prone to having sudden inspirations. Some men do not quickly have good ideas but arrive at the answer

by slow consideration. Well, if we investigate the heart of the matter, even though people's natural abilities differ, bearing

in mind the Four Oaths, when your thinking rises above concern for your own welfare, wisdom which is independent of

thought appears. Whoever thinks deeply on things, even though he may carefully consider the future, will usually think

around the basis of his own welfare. By the result of such evil thinking he will only perform evil acts. It is very difficult for

most silly fellows to rise above thinking of their own welfare.

"So when you embark upon something, before you start, fix your intention on the Four Oaths and put selfishness behind

you. Then you cannot fail.

"The Four Oaths: Never be late with respect to the Way of the warrior. Be useful to the lord. Be respectful to your

parents. Get beyond love and grief: exist for the good of man."

^"^ Our lord: This refers to the daimyo, who retained numbers of samurai to fight for them (see previous note).

^5 Kashima Kantori sfirines: The original schools of Kendo can be found in the traditions preserved in Shinto shrines.

Many of the school ancestors are entombed in the Kanto area, not far from Tokyo, where the Kashima and Kantori

shrines still stand. Arima Kihei, the samurai whom Musashi killed at the age of thirteen, was a fencer of the Shinto school

associated with the shrines. The Yagyu school was derived from the Kashima style. Shinto was a religion of industry in

everyday life, and the War Gods enshrined at Kashima and Kantori are still invoked today as part of the everyday

practice of the Shinto school.

15 Dojo: "Dojo" means "Way place", the room where something is studied.



There are four Ways^^ in which men pass through life: as gentlemen, farmers, artisans
and merchants.

The way of the farmer. Using agricultural instruments, he sees springs through to
autumns with an eye on the changes of season.

Second is the Way of the merchant. The wine maker obtains his ingredients and
puts them to use to make his living. The Way of the merchant is always to live by taking
profit. This is the Way of the merchant.

Thirdly the gentleman warrior, carrying the weaponry of his Way. The Way of the
warrior is to master the virtue of his weapons. If a gentleman dislikes strategy he will not
appreciate the benefit of weaponry, so must he not have a little taste for this?

Fourthly the Way of the artisan. The Way of the carpenter"^ is to become proficient
in the use of his tools, first to lay his plans with a true measure and then perform his work
according to plan. Thus he passes through life. These are the four Ways of the
gentleman, the farmer, the artisan and the merchant.



Comparing the Way of the Carpenter to Strategy

The comparison with carpentry is through the connection with houses. Houses of the
nobility, houses of warriors, the Four houses,'' ruin of houses, thriving of houses, the style
of the house, the tradition of the house, and the name of the house. The carpenter uses a
master plan of the building, and the Way of strategy is similar in that there is a plan of
campaign. If you want to learn the craft of war, ponder over this book. The teacher is as a
needle, the disciple is as thread. You must practice constantly.

Like the foreman carpenter, the commander must know natural rules, and the rules
of the country, and the rules of houses. This is the Way of the foreman.

The foreman carpenter must know the architectural theory of towers and temples,
and the plans of palaces, and must employ men to raise up houses. The Way of the
foreman carpenter is the same as the Way of the commander of a warrior house.^"

In the contruction of houses, choice of woods is made. Straight un-knotted timber
of good appearance is used for the revealed pillars, straight timber with small defects is
used for the inner pillars. Timber of the finest appearance, even if a little weak, is used for
the thresholds, lintels, doors, and sliding doors,'' and so on. Good strong timber, though it
be gnarled and knotted, can always be used discreetly in construction. Timber which is
weak or knotted throughout should be used as scaffolding, and later for firewood.

The foreman carpenter allots his men work according to their ability. Floor layers,
makers of sliding doors, thresholds and lintels, ceilings and so on. Those of poor ability lay
the floor joist, and those of lesser ability carve wedges and do such miscellaneous work. If
the foreman knows and deploys his men well the finished work will be good.

The foreman should take into account the abilities and limitations of his men,
circulating among them and asking nothing unreasonable. He should know their morale
and spirit, and encourage them when necessary. This is the same as the principle of



^^ Four Ways: See Translator's Introduction for an explanation of the four classes in Japanese society.

1' Carpenter. All buildings in Japan, except for the walls of the great castles which appeared a few generations before

Musashi's birth, were wooden. "Carpenter" means architect and builder.

13 Four Houses: There were four branches of the Fujiwara family, who dominated Japan in the Heian period. There are

also four different schools of tea.

2" Warrior house: The warrior families who had been in control of Japan for most of her history kept private armies, each

with its own commander.

21 Sliding doors: Japanese buildings made liberal use of sliding doors, detachable walls, and shutters made of wood

which were put over door openings at night and in bad weather.



strategy.

The Way of Strategy

Like a trooper, the carpenter sharpens his own tools.^^ He carries his equipment in his tool
box, and works under the direction of his foreman. He makes columns and girders with an
axe, shapes floorboards and shelves with a plane, cuts fine openwork and carvings
accurately, giving as excellent a finish as his skill will allow. This is the craft of carpenters.
When the carpenter becomes skilled and understands measures he can become a
foreman.

The carpenter's attainment is, having tools which will cut well, to make small
shrines,^' writing shelves, tables, paper lanterns, chopping boards and pot-lids. These are
the specialities of the carpenter. Things are similar for the trooper. You ought to think
deeply about this.

The attainment of the carpenter is that his work is not warped, that the joints are
not misaligned, and that the work is truly planed so that it meets well and is not merely
finished in sections. This is essential.

If you want to learn this Way, deeply consider the things written in this book one at
a time. You must do sufficient research.



Outline of the Five Books of this Book of Strategy

The Way is shown in five books^ ' concerning different aspects. These are Ground,
Water, Fire, Tradition (Wind)," and Void.''

The body of the Way of strategy from the viewpoint of my Ichi school is explained
in the Ground book. It is difficult to realise the true Way just through sword-fencing. Know
the smallest things and the biggest things, the shallowest things and the deepest things.
As if it were a straight road mapped out on the ground, the first book is called the Ground
book.

Second is the Water book. With water as the basis, the spirit becomes like water.
Water adopts the shape of its receptacle, it is sometimes a trickle and sometimes a wild
sea. Water has a clear blue colour. By the clarity, things of Ichi school are shown in this
book.

If you master the principles of sword-fencing, when you freely beat one man, you
beat any man in the world. The spirit of defeating a man is the same for ten million men.
The strategist makes small things into big things, like building a great Buddha from a one
foot model. I cannot write in detail how this is done. The principle of strategy is having one
thing, to know ten thousand things. Things of Ichi school are written in this the Water
book.

Third is the Fire book. This book is about fighting. The spirit of fire is fierce.



22 Like a trooper, the carpenter sharpens his own tools: Sharpening and polishing the Japanese sword is today a worl<
undertal<en only by a specialist, but perhaps the art was more widespread in the age of war. If a sword is imperfectly
polished and the surface of the blade incorrectly shaped, even if it is a very sharp, fine weapon it will not cut at all well.

23 Smaii shrines: Small shrines to the Shinto gods are found in every Japanese home.

2'' Five bool(s: Go Rin No Sho means a book of five rings. The "Go Dai" (Five Greats) of Buddhism are the five elements
which make up the cosmos: ground, water, fire, wind, void. The "Go Rin" (Five Rings) of Buddhism are the five parts of
the human body: head, left and right elbows, and left and right knees.

25 Wind: The Japanese character for "wind" also means "style".

26 Void: The void, or Nothingness, is a Buddhist term for the illusionary nature of worldly things.



whether the fire be small or big; and so it is with battles. The Way of battles is the same
for man to man fights and for ten thousand a side battles. You must appreciate that spirit
can become big or small. What is big is easy to perceive: what is small is difficult to
perceive. In short, it is difficult for large numbers of men to change position, so their
movements can be easily predicted. An individual can easily change his mind, so his
movements are difficult to predict. You must appreciate this. The essence of this book is
that you must train day and night in order to make quick decisions. In strategy it is
necessary to treat training as a part of normal life with your spirit unchanging. Thus
combat in battle is described in the Fire book.

Fourthly the Wind book. This book is not concerned with my Ichi school but with
other schools of strategy. By Wind I mean old traditions, present-day traditions, and family
traditions of strategy. Thus I clearly explain the strategies of the world. This is tradition. It
is difficult to know yourself if you do not know others. To all Ways there are side-tracks. If
you study a Way daily, and your spirit diverges, you may think you are obeying a good
way, but objectively it is not the true Way. If you are following the true Way and diverge a
little, this will later become a large divergence. You must realise this. Other strategies
have come to be thought of as mere sword-fencing, and it is not unreasonable that this
should be so. The benefit of my strategy, although it includes sword-fencing, lies in a
separate principle. I have explained what is commonly meant by strategy in other schools
in the Tradition (Wind) book.

Fifthly, the book of the Void. By Void I mean that which has no beginning and no
end. Attaining this principle means not attaining the principle. The Way of strategy is the
Way of nature. When you appreciate the power of nature, knowing the rhythm of any
situation, you will be able to hit the enemy naturally and strike naturally. All this is the Way
of the Void. I intend to show how to follow the true Way according to nature in the book of
the Void.



The Name Ichi Ryu Ni To (One school-Two swords)

Warriors, both commanders and troopers, carry two swords^^ at their belt. In olden times
these were called the long sword and the sword; nowadays they are known as the sword
and the companion sword. Let it suffice to say that in our land, whatever the reason, a
warrior carries two swords at his belt. It is the Way of the warrior.

"Nito Ichi Ryu" shows the advantage of using both swords.

The spear and halberd" are weapons that are carried out of doors.

Students of the Ichi school Way of strategy should train from the start with the
sword and long sword in either hand. This is the truth: when you sacrifice your life, you
must make fullest use of your weaponry. It is false not to do so, and to die with a weapon
yet undrawn.



2'' Two swords: The samurai wore two swords thrust through the belt with the cutting edges upward on the left side. The
shorter, or companion, sword was carried at all times, and the longer sword worn only out of doors. From time to time
there were rules governing the style and length of swords. Samurai carried two swords but other classes were allowed
only one sword for protection against brigands on the roads between towns (see Translator's Introduction). The samurai
kept their swords at their bedsides, and there were racks for long swords inside the vestibule of every samurai home.
28 Spear and halberd: The techniques for spear and halberd fighting are the same as those of sword fighting. Spears
were first popular in the Muromachi period, primarily as arms for the vast armies of common infantry, and later became
objects of decoration for the processions of the daimyo to and from the capital in the Tokugawa period. The spear is
used to cut and thrust, and is not thrown.

The halberd and similar weapons with long curved blades were especially effective against cavalry, and came to be used
by women who might have to defend their homes in the absence of menfolk. The art is widely studied by women today.



If you hold a sword with both hands, it is difficult to wield it freely to left and right,
so my method is to carry the sword in one hand. This does not apply to large weapons
such as the spear or halberd, but swords and companion swords can be carried in one
hand. It is encumbering to hold a sword in both hands when you are on horseback, when
running on uneven roads, on swampy ground, muddy rice fields, stony ground, or in a
crowd of people. To hold the long sword in both hands is not the true Way, for if you carry
a bow or spear or other arms in your left hand you have only one hand free for the long
sword. However, when it is difficult to cut an enemy down with one hand, you must use
both hands. It is not difficult to wield a sword in one hand; the Way to learn this is to train
with two long swords, one in each hand. It will seem difficult at first, but everything is
difficult at first. Bows are difficult to draw, halberds are difficult to wield; as you become
accustomed to the bow so your pull will become stronger. When you become used to
wielding the long sword, you will gain the power of the Way and wield the sword well.

As I will explain in the second book, the Water Book, there is no fast way of
wielding the long sword. The long sword should be wielded broadly, and the companion
sword closely. This is the first thing to realise.

According to this Ichi school, you can win with a long weapon, and yet you can
also win with a short weapon. In short, the Way of the Ichi school is the spirit of winning,
whatever the weapon and whatever its size.

It is better to use two swords rather than one when you are fighting a crowd and
especially if you want to take a prisoner.

These things cannot be explained in detail. From one thing, know ten thousand
things. When you attain the Way of strategy there will not be one thing you cannot see.
You must study hard.



The Benefit of the Two Characters Reading "Strategy"

Masters of the long sword are called strategists. As for the other military arts, those who
master the bow are called archers, those who master the spear are called spearmen,
those who master the gun^^ are called marksmen, those who master the halberd are
called halberdiers. But we do not call masters of the Way of the long sword
"longswordsmen", nor do we speak of "companionswordsmen". Because bows, guns,
spears and halberds are all warriors' equipment they are certainly part of strategy. To
master the virtue of the long sword is to govern the world and oneself, thus the long sword
is the basis of strategy. The principle is "strategy by means of the long sword". If he
attains the virtue of the long sword, one man can beat ten men. Just as one man can beat
ten, so a hundred men can beat a thousand, and a thousand men can beat ten thousand.
In my strategy, one man is the same as ten thousand, so this strategy is the complete
warrior's craft.

The Way of the warrior does not include other Ways, such as Confucianism,
Buddhism, certain traditions, artistic accomplishments and dancing.'" But even though
these are not part of the Way, if you know the Way broadly you will see it in everything.
Men must polish their particular Way.



29 The gun: The Japanese gun was matchlock, the form in which it was first introduced into the country by missionaries.
The matchlocl< remained until the nineteenth century.

3� Dancing: There are various kinds of dancing. There are festival dances, such as the harvest dance, which incorporate
local characteristics and are very colorful, sometimes involving many people. There is Noh theatre, which is enacted by a
few performers using stylized dance-movements. There are also dances of fan and dances of sword.



The Benefit of Weapons in Strategy

There is a time and a place for use of weapons.

The best use of the companion sword is in a confined space, or when you are
engaged closely with an opponent. The long sword can be used effectively in all
situations.

The halberd is inferior to the spear on the battlefield. With the spear you can take
the initiative; the halberd is defensive. In the hands of one of two men of equal ability, the
spear gives a little extra strength. Spear and halberd both have their uses, but neither is
very beneficial in confined spaces. They cannot be used for taking a prisoner. They are
essentially weapons for the field.

Anyway, if you learn "indoor" techniques,^^ you will think narrowly and forget the
true Way. Thus you will have difficulty in actual encounters.

The bow is tactically strong at the commencement of battle, especially battles on a
moor, as it is possible to shoot quickly from among the spearmen. However, it is
unsatisfactory in sieges, or when the enemy is more than forty yards away. For this
reason there are nowadays few traditional schools of archery. There is little use nowadays
for this kind of skill.

From inside fortifications, the gun has no equal among weapons. It is the supreme
weapon on the field before the ranks clash, but once swords are crossed the gun
becomes useless.

One of the virtues of the bow is that you can see the arrows in flight and correct
your aim accordingly, whereas gunshot cannot be seen. You must appreciate the
importance of this.

Just as a horse must have endurance and no defects, so it is with weapons.
Horses should walk strongly, and swords and companion swords should cut strongly.
Spears and halberds must stand up to heavy use: bows and guns must be sturdy.
Weapons should be hardy rather than decorative.

You should not have a favourite weapon. To become over-familiar with one
weapon is as much a fault as not knowing it sufficiently well. You should not copy others,
but use weapons which you can handle properly. It is bad for commanders and troops to
have likes and dislikes. These are things you must learn thoroughly.



Timing in Strategy

There is timing in everything. Timing in strategy cannot be mastered without a great deal
of practice.

Timing is important in dancing and pipe or string music, for they are in rhythm only
if timing is good. Timing and rhythm are also involved in the military arts, shooting bows
and guns, and riding horses. In all skills and abilities there is timing.

There is also timing in the Void.

There is timing in the whole life of the warrior, in his thriving and declining, in his
harmony and discord. Similarly, there is timing in the Way of the merchant, in the rise and
fall of capital. All things entail rising and falling timing. You must be able to discern this. In
strategy there are various timing considerations. From the outset you must know the
applicable timing and the inapplicable timing, and from among the large and small things
and the fast and slow timings find the relevant timing, first seeing the distance timing and

31 Indoor techniques: Dojos were mostly where a great deal of formality and ritual was observed, safe from the prying
eyes of rival schools.

the background timing. This is the main thing in strategy. It is especially important to know
the background timing, otherwise your strategy will become uncertain.

You win in battles with the timing in the Void born of the timing of cunning by
knowing the enemies' timing, and this using a timing which the enemy does not expect.

All the five books are chiefly concerned with timing. You must train sufficiently to
appreciate all this.

If you practise day and night in the above Ichi school strategy, your spirit will
naturally broaden. Thus is large scale strategy and the strategy of hand to hand combat
propagated in the world. This is recorded for the first time in the five books of Ground,
Water, Fire, Tradition (Wind), and Void. This is the Way for men who want to learn my
strategy:

Do not think dishonestly.

The Way is in training.

Become aquainted with every art.

Know the Ways of all professions.

Distinguish between gain and loss in worldly matters.

Develop intuitive judgement and understanding for everything.

Perceive those things which cannot be seen.

Pay attention even to trifles.

Do nothing which is of no use.

It is important to start by setting these broad principles in your heart, and train in the Way
of strategy. If you do not look at things on a large scale it will be difficult for you to master
strategy. If you learn and attain this strategy you will never lose even to twenty or thirty
enemies. More than anything to start with you must set your heart on strategy and
earnestly stick to the Way. You will come to be able to actually beat men in fights, and to
be able to win with your eye. Also by training you will be able to freely control your own
body, conquer men with your body, and with sufficient training you will be able to beat ten
men with your spirit. When you have reached this point, will it not mean that you are
invincible?

Moreover, in large scale strategy the superior man will manage many subordinates
dextrously, bear himself correctly, govern the country and foster the people, thus
preserving the ruler's discipline. If there is a Way involving the spirit of not being defeated,
to help oneself and gain honour, it is the Way of strategy.

Teruo Magonojo'' SHINMEN MUSASHI

� Teruo Magonojo: The pupil, sometimes called Teruo Nobuyuki, to whom Musashi addressed Go Rin No Sho.

The Water Book

The spirit of the Ni Ten Ichi school of strategy is based on water, and this Water Book
explains methods of victory as the long-sword form of the Ichi school. Language does not
extend to explaining the Way in detail, but it can be grasped intuitively. Study this book;
read a word then ponder on it. If you interpret the meaning loosely you will mistake the
Way.

The principles of strategy are written down here in terms of single combat, but you
must think broadly so that you attain an understanding for ten-thousand-a-side battles.

Strategy is different from other things in that if you mistake the Way even a little
you will become bewildered and fall into bad ways.

If you merely read this book you will not reach the Way of strategy. Absorb the
things written in this book. Do not just read, memorise or imitate, but so that you realise
the principle from within your own heart study hard to absorb these things into your body.



Spiritual Bearing in Strategy

In strategy your spiritual bearing must not be any different from normal. Both in fighting
and in everyday life you should be determined though calm. Meet the situation without
tenseness yet not recklessly, your spirit settled yet unbiased. Even when your spirit is
calm do not let your body relax, and when your body is relaxed do not let your spirit
slacken. Do not let your spirit be influenced by your body, or your body influenced by your
spirit. Be neither insufficiently spirited nor over spirited. An elevated spirit is weak and a
low spirit is weak. Do not let the enemy see your spirit.

Small people must be completely familiar with the spirit of large people, and large
people must be familiar with the spirit of small people. Whatever your size, do not be
misled by the reactions of your own body. With your spirit open and unconstricted, look at
things from a high point of view. You must cultivate your wisdom and spirit. Polish your
wisdom: learn public justice, distinguish between good and evil, study the Ways of
different arts one by one. When you cannot be deceived by men you will have realised the
wisdom of strategy.

The wisdom of strategy is different from other things. On the battlefield, even when
you are hard-pressed, you should ceaselessly research the principles of strategy so that
you can develop a steady spirit.



Stance in Strategy

Adopt a stance with the head erect, neither hanging down, nor looking up, nor twisted.
Your forehead and the space between your eyes should not be wrinkled. Do not roll your



eyes nor allow them to blink, but slightly narrow them. With your features composed, keep
the line of your nose straight with a feeling of slightly flaring your nostrils. Hold the line of
the rear of the neck straight: instil vigour into your hairline, and in the same way from the
shoulders down through your entire body. Lower both shoulders and, without the buttocks
jutting out, put strength into your legs from the knees to the tops of your toes. Brace your
abdomen so that you do not bend at the hips. Wedge your companion sword in your belt
against your abdomen, so that your belt is not slack � this is called "wedging in".

In all forms of strategy, it is necessary to maintain the combat stance in everyday
life and to make your everyday stance your combat stance. You must research this well.



The Gaze in Strategy

The gaze should be large and broad. This is the twofold gaze "Perception and Sight".
Perception is strong and sight weak.

In strategy it is important to see distant things as if they were close and to take a
distanced view of close things. It is important in strategy to know the enemy's sword and
not to be distracted by insignificant movements of his sword. You must study this. The
gaze is the same for single combat and for large-scale combat.

It is necessary in strategy to be able to look to both sides without moving the
eyeballs. You cannot master this ability quickly. Learn what is written here: use this gaze
in everyday life and do not vary it whatever happens.



Holding the Long Sword

Grip the long sword with a rather floating feeling in your thumb and forefinger, with the
middle finger neither tight nor slack, and with the last two fingers tight. It is bad to have
play in your hands.

When you take up a sword, you must feel intent on cutting the enemy. As you cut
an enemy you must not change your grip, and your hands must not "cower". When you
dash the enemy's sword aside, or ward it off, or force it down, you must slightly change
the feeling in your thumb and forefinger. Above all, you must be intent on cutting the
enemy in the way you grip the sword.

The grip for combat and for sword-testing^^ is the same. There is no such thing as
a "man-cutting grip".

Generally, I dislike fixedness in both long swords and hands. Fixedness means a
dead hand. Pliability is a living hand. You must bear this in mind.

Footwork^"^

With the tips of your toes somewhat floating, tread firmly with your heels. Whether you
move fast or slow, with large or small steps, your feet must always move as in normal



33 Sword Testing: Swords were tested by highly specialised professional testers. The sword would be fitted into a special
mounting and test cuts made on bodies, bundles of straw, armour, sheets of metal, etc. Sometimes, appraisal marks of a
sword testing inscribed on the tangs of old blades are found.

3'* Footwork: Different methods of moving are used in different schools. Yin-Yang, or "In-Yo" in Japanese, is female-male,
dark-light, right-left. Musashi advocates this "level mind" kind of walking, although he is emphatic about the significance
of these parameters -issues of right and left foot arise in the Wind book of Go Rin No Sho. Old Jujitsu schools advocate
making the first attack with the left side forward.



walking. I dislike the three walking methods known as "jumping-foot", "floating-foot" and
"fixed-steps".

So-called "Yin-Yang foot" is important to the Way. Yin-Yang foot means not
moving only one foot. It means moving your feet left-right and right-left when cutting,
withdrawing, or warding off a cut. You should not move one foot preferentially.



The Five Attitudes

The five attitudes are: Upper, Middle, Lower, Right Side, and Left Side. These are the five.
Although attitude has these five dimensions, the one purpose of all of them is to cut the
enemy. There are none but these five attitudes.

Whatever attitude you are in, do not be conscious of making the attitude; think only
of cutting.

Your attitude should be large or small according to the situation. Upper, Lower and
Middle attitudes are decisive. Left Side and Right Side attitudes are fluid. Left and Right
attitudes should be used if there is an obstruction overhead or to one side. The decision to
use Left or Right depends on the place.

The essence of the Way is this. To understand attitude you must thoroughly
understand the Middle attitude. The Middle attitude is the heart of the attitudes. If we look
at strategy on a broad scale, the Middle attitude is the seat of the commander, with the
other four attitudes following the commander. You must appreciate this.



The Way of the Long Sword

Knowing the Way of the long sword^'' means we can wield with two fingers the sword that
we usually carry. If we know the path of the sword well, we can wield it easily.

If you try to wield the long sword quickly you will mistake the Way. To wield the
long sword well you must wield it calmly. If you try to wield it quickly, like a folding fan"'' or
a short sword, you will err by using "short sword chopping". You cannot cut a man with a
long sword using this method.

When you have cut downwards with the long sword, lift it straight upwards, when
you cut sideways, return the sword along a sideways path. Return the sword in a
reasonable way, always stretching the elbows broadly. Wield the sword strongly. This is
the Way of the long sword.

If you learn to use the five approaches of my strategy, you will be able to wield a
sword well. You must train constantly.

The Five Approaches^ ''

� The first approach is the Middle attitude. Confront the enemy with the point of your
sword against his face. When he attacks, dash his sword to the right and "ride" it.



35 The Way of the Long Sword: The Way as a way of life, and as the natural path of a sword blade. There is a natural
movement of the sword associated with a natural behavior according to Kendo ethics.

36 Folding fan: An item carried by men and women in the hot summer months. Armoured officers sometimes carried an
iron war fan.

3'' Tfie Five Approacfies: Who can understand Musashi's methods? It is necessary to study traditional schools and basic
cutting practice. Bear in mind that fighting technique may start from a greater distance than it seems to at a first glance. It
is said that the man who has faced death at the point of a sword has an elevated understanding.



Or, when the enemy attacks, deflect the point of his sword by hitting downwards,
keep your long sword where it is, and as the enemy renews the attack cut his arms
from below. This is the first method.

The five approaches are this kind of thing. You must train repeatedly using a
long sword in order to learn them. When you master my Way of the long sword, you
will be able to control any attack the enemy makes. I assure you, there are no
attitudes other than the five attitudes of the long sword of NiTo.

� In the second approach with the long sword, from the Upper attitude cut the enemy
just as he attacks. If the enemy evades the cut, keep your sword where it is and,
scooping from below, cut him as he renews the attack. It is possible to repeat the
cut from here.

In this method there are various changes in timing and spirit. You will be able
to understand this by training in the Ichi school. You will always win with the five
long sword methods. You must train repeatedly.

� In the third approach, adopt the Lower attitude, anticipating scooping up. When the
enemy attackes, hit his hands from below. As you do so, he may try to hit your
sword down. If this is the case, cut his upper arm(s) horizontally with a feeling of
"crossing". This means that from the Lower attitudes you hit the enemy at the instant
that he attacks.

You will encounter this method often, both as a beginner and in later
strategy. You must train holding a long sword.

� In this fourth approach, adopt the Left Side attitude. As the enemy attacks, hit his
hands from below. If as you hit his hands he attempts to dash down your sword,
with the feeling of hitting his hands, parry the path of his long sword and cut across
from above your shoulder.

This is the Way of the long sword. Through this method you win by parrying
the line of the enemy's attack. You must study this.

� In the fifth approach, the sword is in the Right Side attitude. In accordance with the
enemy's attack, cross your sword from below at the side to the Upper attitude. Then
cut straight from above.

This method is essential for knowing the Way of the long sword well. If you
can use this method, you can freely wield a heavy long sword.

I cannot describe in detail how to use these five approaches. You must become well
acquainted with my "in harmony with the long sword" Way, learn large-scale timing,
understand the enemy's long sword, and become used to the five approaches from the
outset. You will always win by using these five methods, with various timing
considerations discerning the enemy's spirit. You must consider all this carefully.



The "Attitude-No-Attitude" Teaching

"Attitude No-Attitude" means that there is no need for what are known as long sword
attitudes.

Even so, attitudes exist as the five ways of holding the long sword. However you
hold the sword it must be in such a way that it is easy to cut the enemy well, in
accordance with the situation, the place, and your relation to the enemy. From the Upper
attitude as your spirit lessens you can adopt the Middle attitude, and from the Middle
attitude you can raise the sword a little in your technique and adopt the Upper attitude.



From the Lower attitude you can raise the sword a little and adopt the Middle attitudes as
the occasion demands. According to the situation, if you turn your sword from either the
Left Side or Right Side attitude towards the centre, the Middle or the Lower attitude
results.

The principle of this is called "Existing Attitude � Non-existing Attitude".

The primary thing when you take a sword in your hands is your intention to cut the
enemy, whatever the means. Whenever you parry, hit, spring, strike or touch the enemy's
cutting sword, you must cut the enemy in the same movement. It is essential to attain this.
If you think only of hitting, springing, striking or touching the enemy, you will not be able
actually to cut him. More than anything, you must be thinking of carrying your movement
through to cutting him. You must thoroughly research this.

Attitude in strategy on a larger scale is called "Battle Array". Such attitudes are all
for winning battles. Fixed formation is bad. Study this well.



To Hit the Enemy "In One Timing"

"In One Timing" means, when you have closed with the enemy, to hit him as quickly and
directly as possible, without moving your body or settling your spirit, while you see that he
is still undecided. The timing of hitting before the enemy decides to withdraw, break or hit,
is this "In One Timing".

You must train to achieve this timing, to be able to hit in the timing of an instant.



The "Abdomen Timing of Two"

When you attack and the enemy quickly retreats, as you see him tense you must feint a
cut. Then, as he relaxes, follow up and hit him. This is the "Abdomen Timing of Two".

It is very difficult to attain this merely by reading this book, but you will soon
understand with a little instruction.



No Design, No Conception ^^

In this method, when the enemy attacks and you decide to attack, hit with your body, and
hit with your spirit, and hit from the Void with your hands, accelerating strongly. This is the
"No Design, No Conception" cut.

This is the most important method of hitting. It is often used. You must train hard to
understand it.



The Flowing Water Cut

The "Flowing Water Cut" is used when you are struggling blade to blade with the enemy.
When he breaks and quickly withdraws trying to spring with his long sword, expand your
body and spirit and cut him as slowly as possible with your long sword, following your
body like stagnant water. You can cut with certainty if you learn this. You must discern the
enemy's grade.



38 No Design, No Conception: "Munen Muso"-this means the ability to act calmly and naturally even in the face of
danger. It is the highest accord with existance, when a man's word and his actions are spontaneously the same.



Continuous Cut

When you attack and the enemy also attacks, and your swords spring together, in one
action cut his head, hands and legs. When you cut several places with one sweep of the
long sword, it is the "Continuous Cut". You must practise this cut; it is often used. With
detailed practice you should be able to understand it.



The Fire and Stones Cut

The Fires and Stones Cut means that when the enemy's long sword and your long sword
clash together you cut as strongly as possible without raising the sword even a little. This
means cutting quickly with the hands, body and legs � all three cutting strongly. If you train
well enough you will be able to strike strongly.



The Red Leaves Cut

The Red Leaves Cut^^ means knocking down the enemy's long sword. The spirit should
be getting control of his sword. When the enemy is in a long sword attitude in front of you
and intent on cutting, hitting and parrying, you strongly hit the enemy's sword with the Fire
and Stones Cut, perhaps in the design of the "No Design, No Conception" Cut. If you then
beat down the point of his sword with a sticky feeling, he will necessarily drop the sword. If
you practise this cut it becomes easy to make the enemy drop his sword. You must train
repetitively.



The Body in Place of the Long Sword

Also "the long sword in place of the body". Usually we move the body and the sword at
the same time to cut the enemy. However, according to the enemy's cutting method, you
can dash against him with your body first, and afterwards cut with the sword. If his body is
immoveable, you can cut first with the long sword, but generally you hit first with the body
and then cut with the long sword. You must research this well and practise hitting.



Cut and Slash

To cut and slash are two different things. Cutting, whatever form of cutting it is, is decisive,
with a resolute spirit. Slashing is nothing more than touching the enemy. Even if you slash
strongly, and even if the enemy dies instantly, it is slashing. When you cut, your spirit is
resolved. You must appreciate this. If you first slash the enemy's hands or legs, you must
then cut strongly. Slashing is in spirit the same as touching. When you realise this, they
become indistinguishable. Learn this well.



Chinese Monkey's Body



^^ Red Leaves Cut Presumably Musashi is alluding here to falling, dying leaves.



The Chinese Monkey's Body"*" is the spirit of not stretching out your arms. The spirit is to
get in quickly, without in the least extending your arms, before the enemy cuts. If you are
intent upon not stretching out your arms you are effectively far away, the spirit is to go in
with your whole body. When you come to within arm's reach it becomes easy to move
your body in. You must research this well.



Glue and Lacquer Emulsion Body



m41



The spirit of "Glue and Lacquer Emulsion Body" is to stick to the enemy and not separate from
him. When you approach the enemy, stick firmly with your head, body and legs. People tend to
advance their head and legs quickly, but their body lags behind. You should stick firmly so that
there is not the slightest gap between the enemy's body and your body. You must consider this
carefully.



To Strive for Height

By "to strive for height" is meant, when you close with the enemy, to strive with him for
superior height without cringing. Stretch your legs, stretch your hips, and stretch your neck
face to face with him. When you think you have won, and you are the higher, thrust in
strongly. You must learn this.



To Apply Stickiness

When the enemy attacks and you also attack with the long sword, you should go in with a
sticky feeling and fix your long sword against the enemy's as you receive his cut. The
spirit of stickiness is not hitting very strongly, but hitting so that the long swords do not
separate easily. It is best to approach as calmly as possible when hitting the enemy's long
sword with stickiness. The difference between "Stickiness" and "Entanglement" is that
stickiness is firm and entanglement is weak. You must appreciate this.



The Body Strike

The Body Strike means to approach the enemy through a gap in his guard. The spirit is to
strike him with your body. Turn your face a little aside and strike the enemy's breast with
your left shoulder thrust out. Approach with a spirit of bouncing the enemy away, striking
as strongly as possible in time with your breathing. If you achieve this method of closing
with the enemy, you will be able to knock him ten or twenty feet away. It is possible to
strike the enemy until he is dead. Train well.



Three Ways to Parry His Attack

There are three methods to parry a cut:

First, by dashing the enemy's long sword to your right, as if thrusting at his eyes.



'"' Chinese Monkey"s Body: A Chinese monkey here means a short-armed monkey.

''I Glue and lacquer emulsion: The lacquer work which takes its name from Japan, used to coat furniture and home

utensils, architecture, weapons and armour.



when he makes an attack.

Or, to parry by thrusting the enemy's long sword towards his right eye with the
feeling of snipping his neck.

Or, when you have a short "long sword", without worrying about parrying the
enemy's long sword, to close with him quickly, thrusting at his face with your left hand.

These are the three ways of parrying. You must bear in mind that you can always
clench your left hand and thrust at the enemy's face with your fist. For this it is necessary
to train well.



To Stab at the Face

To stab at the face means, when you are in confrontation with the enemy, that your spirit
is intent on stabbing at his face, following the line of the blades with the point of your long
sword. If you are intent on stabbling at his face, his face and body will become rideable.
When the enemy becomes rideable, there are various opportunities for winning. You must
concentrate on this. When fighting and the enemy's body becomes as if rideable, you can
win quickly, so you ought not to forget to stab at the face. You must persue the value of
this technique through training.



To Stab at the Heart

To stab at the heart means, when fighting and there are obstructions above or to the
sides, and whenever it is difficult to cut, to thrust at the enemy. You must stab the enemy's
breast without letting the point of your long sword waver, showing the enemy the ridge of
the blade square-on, and with the spirit of deflecting his long sword. The spirit of this
principle is often useful when we become tired or for some reason our long sword will not
cut. You must understand the application of this method.



To Scold "Tut-TUT!"

"Scold" means that, when the enemy tries to counter-cut as you attack, you counter-cut
again from below as if thrusting at him, trying to hold him down. With very quick timing you
cut, scolding the enemy. Thrust up, "Tut!", and cut "TUT!" This timing is encountered time
and time again in exchanges of blows. The way to scold Tut-TUT is to time the cut
simultaneously with raising your long sword as if to thrust the enemy. You must learn this
through repetitive practice.



The Smacking Parry

By "smacking parry" is meant that when you clash swords with the enemy, you meet his
attacking cut on your long sword with a tee-dum, tee-dum rhythm, smacking his sword
and cutting him. The spirit of the smacking parry is not parrying, or smacking strongly, but
smacking the enemy's long sword in accordance with his attacking cut, primarily intent on
quickly cutting him. If you understand the timing of smacking, however hard your long
swords clash together, your swordpoint will not be knocked back even a little. You must
research sufficiently to realise this.



There are Many Enemies

"There are many enemies'"*^ applies when you are fighting one against many. Draw both
sword and companion sword and assume a wide-stretched left and right attitude. The
spirit is to chase the enemies around from side to side, even though they come from all
four directions. Observe their attacking order, and go to meet first those who attack first.
Sweep your eyes around broadly, carefully examining the attacking order, and cut left and
right alternately with your swords. Waiting is bad. Always quickly reassume your attitudes
to both sides, cut the enemies down as they advance, crushing them in the direction from
which they attack. Whatever you do, you must drive the enemy together, as if tying a line
of fishes, and when they are seen to be piled up, cut them down strongly without giving
them room to move.



The Advantage When Coming to Blows

You can know how to win through strategy with the long sword, but it cannot be clearly
explained in writing. You must practise diligently in order to understand how to win.
Oral tradition:*^'The true Way of strategy is revealed in the long sword."



One Cut

You can win with certainty with the spirit of "one cut".^* It is difficult to attain this if you do
not learn strategy well. If you train well in this Way, strategy will come from your heart and
you will be able to win at will. You must train diligently.



Direct Communication

The spirit of "Direct Communication" is how the true Way of the NiTo Ichi school is
received and handed down.

Oral tradition: "Teach your body strategy."

Recorded in the above book is an outline of Ichi school sword fighting.

To learn how to win with the long sword in strategy, first learn the five approaches
and the five attitudes, and absorb the Way of the long sword naturally in your body. You
must understand spirit and timing, handle the long sword naturally, and move body and
legs in harmony with your spirit. Whether beating one man or two, you will then know
values in strategy.

Study the contents of this book, taking one item at a time, and through fighting with
enemies you will gradually come to know the principle of the Way.



''^ There are many enemies: Musashi is held to be the inventor of the Two Sword style. His school is sometimes called
"Nito Ryu" (two sword school) and sometimes "Niten Ryu" (two heavens school). He writes that the use of two swords is
for when there are many enemies, but people practise a style of fencing with a sword in each hand to give practical
advantage in fencing. Musashi used the words "two swords" when meaning to use all one's resources in combat. He
never used two swords when up against a skilled swordsman.

'�^ Oral tradition: Other Kendo schools also have oral traditions as opposed to teachings passed on in formal technique.
'?'' One cut Whatever this means, it is wothwhile to note the "Hitotsu Gachi" (One Victory), the Kiri Otoshi technique of the
Itto Ryu school, where one cut provides attack and defence, cutting down the enemy's sword and spirit, and the related
"Itchi no Tachi" (Long Sword of One) of the Shinto style.



Deliberately, with a patient spirit, absorb the virtue of all this, from time to time
raising your hand in combat. Maintain this spirit whenever you cross swords with an
enemy.

Step by step walk the thousand-mile road.

Study strategy over the years and achieve the spirit of the warrior. Today is victory
over yourself of yesterday; tomorrow is your victory over lesser men. Next, in order to beat
more skilful men, train according to this book, not allowing your heart to be swayed along
a side-track. Even if you kill an enemy, if it is not based on what you have learned it is not
the true Way.

If you attain this Way of victory, then you will be able to beat several tens of men.
What remains is sword-fighting ability, which you can attain in battles and duels.



The Second Year of Shoho, the twelfth day of the fifth month (1645)

Teruo Magonojo SHINMEN MUSASHI



The Fire Book



In this the Fire Book of the NiTo Ichi school of strategy I describe fighting as fire.

In the first place, people think narrowly about the benefit of strategy. By using only
their fingertips, they only know the benefit of three of the five inches of the wrist. They let a
contest be decided, as with the folding fan, merely by the span of their forearms. They
specialise in the small matter of dexterity, learning such trifles as hand and leg
movements with the bamboo practise sword. ^^

In my strategy, the training for killing enemies is by way of many contests, fighting
for survival, discovering the meaning of life and death, learning the Way of the sword,
judging the strength of attacks and understanding the Way of the "edge and ridge" of the
sword.

You cannot profit from small techniques particularly when full armor is worn.*' My
Way of strategy is the sure method to win when fighting for your life one man against five
or ten. There is nothing wrong with the principle "one man can beat ten, so a thousand
men can beat ten thousand". You must research this. Of course you cannot assemble a
thousand or ten thousand men for everyday training. But you can become a master of
strategy by training alone with a sword, so that you can understand the enemy's
strategies, his strength and resources, and come to appreciate how to apply strategy to
beat ten thousand enemies.

Any man who wants to master the essence of my strategy must research
diligently, training morning and evening. Thus can he polish his skill, become free from
self, and realise extrordinary ability. He will come to posess miraculous power.

This is the practical result of strategy.



Depending on the Place

Examine your environment

Stand in the sun; that is, take up an attitude with the sun behind you. If the
situation does not allow this, you must try to keep the sun on your right side. In buildings,
you must stand with the entrance behind you or to your right. Make sure that your rear is
unobstructed, and that there is free space on your left, your right side being occupied with
your sword attitude. At night, if the enemy can be seen, keep the fire behind you and the
entrance to your right, and otherwise take up your attitude as above. You must look down
on the enemy, and take up your attitude on slightly higher places. For example, the



"?s Bamboo practice sword: There have been practise swords of various l<inds throughout the history of Kendo: some are
made of spliced bamboo covered with cloth or hide.

^ Full armour: The words "Roku Gu" (six pieces) are used. This is a set of armour consisting of Cuiras, gauntlets,
sleeves, apron and thigh pieces, or, according to another convention, body armour, helmet, mask, thigh pieces, gauntlets
and leg pieces.



Kamiza'*^ in a house is thought of as a high place.

When the fight comes, always endeavour to chase the enemy around to your left
side. Chase him towards awkward places, and try to keep him with his back to awkward
places. When the enemy gets into an inconvenient position, do not let him look around,
but conscientiously chase him around and pin him down. In houses, chase the enemy into
the thresholds, lintels, doors, verandas, pillars, and so on, again not letting him see his
situation.

Always chase the enemy into bad footholds, obstacles at the side, and so on,
using the virtues of the place to establish predominant positions from which to fight. You
must research and train diligently in this.



The Three Methods to Forestall the Enemy



48



The first is to forestall him by attacking. This is called Ken No Sen (to set him up).

Another method is to forestall him as he attacks. This is called Tai No Sen (to wait
for the initiative).

The other method is when you and the enemy attack together. This is called Tai
Tai No Sen (to accompany him and forestall him).

There are no methods of taking the lead other than these three. Because you can
win quickly by taking the lead, it is one of the most important things in strategy. There are
several things involved in taking the lead. You must make the best of the situation, see
through the enemy's spirit so that you grasp his strategy and defeat him. It is impossible to
write about this in detail.



The First-Ken No Sen

When you decide to attack, keep calm and dash in quickly, forestalling the enemy. Or you
can advance seemingly strongly but with a reserved spirit, forestalling him with the
reserve.

Alternately, advance with as strong a spirit as possible, and when you reach the
enemy move with your feet a little quicker than normal, unsettling him and overwhelming
him sharply.

Or, with your spirit calm, attack with a feeling of constantly crushing the enemy,
from first to last. The spirit is to win in the depths of the enemy.

These are all Ken No Sen.



The Second-Tai No Sen

When the enemy attacks, remain undisturbed but feign weakness. As the enemy reaches
you, suddenly move away indicating that you intend to jump aside, then dash in attacking
strongly as soon as you see the enemy relax. This is one way.



'''' Kazima: This is the residence of the ancestral spirit of a house; the head of the house sits nearest this place. It is often
a slightly raised recess in a wall, sometimes containing a hanging scroll, armour, or other religious property.
't* The three methods to forestall an enemy: A great swordsman or other artist will have mastered the ability to forestall
the enemy. The great swordsman is always "before" his environment. This does not mean speed. You cannot beat a
good swordsman, because he subconsciously sees the origin of every real action. One can still see in Kendo practice
wonderful old gentlemen slowly hitting young champoins on the head almost casually. It is the practiced ability to sum up
a changing situation instantly.



Or, as the enemy attacks, attack more strongly, taking advantage of the resulting
disorder in his timing to win.

This is the Tai No Sen principle.



The Third-Tai Tai No Sen

When the enemy makes a quick attack, you must attack strongly and calmly, aim for his
weak point as he draws near, and strongly defeat him.

Or, if the enemy attacks calmly, you must observe his movement and, with your
body rather floating, join in with his movements as he draws near. Move quickly and cut
him strongly.

This is Tai Tai No Sen

These things cannot be clearly explained in words. You must research what is written
here. In these three ways of forestalling, you must judge the situation. This does not mean
that you always attack first; but if the enemy attacks first you can lead him around. In
strategy, you have effectively won when you forestall the enemy, so you must train well to
attain this.



To Hold Down a Pillow

"To Hold Down a Pillow"^^ means not allowing the enemy's head to rise.

In contests of stategy it is bad to be led about by the enemy. You must always be
able to lead the enemy about. Obviously the enemy will also be thinking of doing this, but
he cannot forestall you if you do not allow him to come out. In strategy, you must stop the
enemy as he attempts to cut; you must push down his thrust, and throw off his hold when
he tries to grapple. This is the meaning of "to hold down a pillow". When you have
grasped this principle, whatever the enemy tries to bring about in the fight you will see in
advance and suppress it. The spirit is to check his attack at the syllable "at . . .", when he
jumps check his advance at the syllable "ju . . .", and check his cut at "cu . . .".

The important thing in strategy is to suppress the enemy's useful actions but allow
his useless actions. However, doing this alone is defensive. First, you must act according
to the Way, suppress the enemy's techniques, foiling his plans, and thence command him
directly. When you can do this you will be a master of strategy. You must train well and
research "holding down a pillow".



Crossing at a Ford

"Crossing at a ford" means, for example, crossing the sea at a strait, or crossing over a
hundred miles of broad sea at a crossing place. I believe this "crossing at a ford" occurs
often in a man's lifetime. It means setting sail even though your friends stay in harbour,
knowing the route, knowing the soundness of your ship and the favour of the day. When
all the conditions are met, and there is perhaps a favourable wind, or a tailwind, then set
sail. If the wind changes within a few miles of your destination, you must row across the
remaining distance without sail.



''^ To hold down a pillow: Note that samurai and Japanese ladies slept with heads on a small wooden pillow shaped to
accommodate their hairstyle.



If you attain this spirit, it applies to everyday life. You must always think of crossing
at a ford.

In strategy also it is important to "cross at a ford". Discern the enemy's capability
and, knowing your own strong points, "cross the ford" at the advantageous place, as a
good captain crosses a sea route. If you succeed in crossing at the best place, you may
take your ease. To cross at a ford means to attack the enemy's weak point, and to put
yourself in an advantageous position. This is how to win in large-scale strategy. The spirit
of crossing at a ford is necessary in both large � and small-scale strategy.

You must research this well.



To Know the Times

"To know the times" means to know the enemy's disposition in battle. Is it flourishing or
waning? By observing the spirit of the enemy's men and getting the best position, you can
work out the enemy's disposition and move your men accordingly. You can win through
this principle of strategy, fighting from a position of advantage.

When in a duel, you must forestall the enemy and attack when you have first
recognised his school of strategy, perceived his quality and his strong and weak points.
Attack in an unsuspected manner, knowing his metre and modulation and the appropriate
timing.

Knowing the times means, if your ability is high, seeing right into things. If you are
thoroughly conversant with strategy, you will recognise the enemy's intentions and thus
have many opportunities to win. You must sufficiently study this.



To Tread Down the Sword

"To tread down the sword" is a principle often used in strategy. First, in large-scale
strategy, when the enemy first discharges bows and guns and then attacks, it is difficult
for us to attack if we are busy loading powder into our guns or notching our arrows. The
spirit is to attack quickly while the enemy is still shooting with bows or guns. The spirit is to
win by "treading down" as we receive the enemy's attack.

In single combat, we cannot get a decisive victory by cutting, with a "tee-dum tee-
dum" feeling, in the wake of the enemy's attacking long sword. We must defeat him at the
start of his attack, in the spirit of treading him down with the feet, so that he cannot rise
again to the attack.

"Treading" does not simply mean treading with the feet. Tread with the body, tread
with the spirit, and, of course, tread and cut with the long sword. You must achieve the
spirit of not allowing the enemy to attack a second time. This is the spirit of forestalling in
every sense. Once at the enemy, you should not aspire just to strike him, but to cling after
the attack. You must study this deeply.



To Know "Collapse"

Everything can collapse. Houses, bodies, and enemies collapse when their rhythm
becomes deranged.

In large-scale strategy, when the enemy starts to collapse you must persue him
without letting the chance go. If you fail to take advantage of your enemies' collapse, they
may recover.



In single combat, the enemy sometimes loses timing and collapses. If you let this
opportunity pass, he may recover and not be so negligent thereafter. Fix your eye on the
enemy's collapse, and chase him, attacking so that you do not let him recover. You must
do this. The chasing attack is with a strong spirit. You must utterly cut the enemy down so
that he does not recover his position. You must understand utterly how to cut down the
enemy.



To Become the Enemy

"To become the enemy" means to think yourself into the enemy's position. In the world
people tend to think of a robber trapped in a house as a fortified enemy. However, if we
think of "becoming the enemy", we feel that the whole world is against us and that there is
no escape. He who is shut inside is a pheasant. He who enters to arrest is a hawk. You
must appreciate this.

In large-scale strategy, people are always under the impression that the enemy is
strong, and so tend to become cautious. But if you have good soldiers, and if you
understand the principles of strategy, and if you know how to beat the enemy, there is
nothing to worry about.

In single combat also you must put yourself in the enemy's position. If you think,
"Here is a master of the Way, who knows the principles of strategy", then you will surely
lose. You must consider this deeply.



To Release Four Hands

"To release four hands"^� is used when you and the enemy are contending with the same
spirit, and the issue cannot be decided. Abandon this spirit and win through an alternative
resource.

In large-scale strategy, when there is a "four hands" spirit, do not give up � it is
man's existence. Immediately throw away this spirit and win with a technique the enemy
does not expect.

In single combat also, when we think we have fallen into the "four hands" situation,
we must defeat the enemy by changing our mind and applying a suitable technique
according to his condition. You must be able to judge this.



To Move the Shade

"To move the shade" is used when you cannot see the enemy's spirit.

In large-scale strategy, when you cannot see the enemy's position, indicate that
you are about to attack strongly, to discover his resources. It is easy then to defeat him
with a different method once you see his resources.

In single combat, if the enemy takes up a rear or side attitude of the long sword so
that you cannot see his intention, make a feint attack, and the enemy will show his long
sword, thinking he sees your spirit. Benefiting from what you are shown, you can win with



5" To release four harids: "Yotsu te o hanasu"-the expression "Yotsu te" means the condition of grappling witti botti
arms engaged with the opponent's arms, or "deadlocl<". It is also the name used to describe various articles with four
corners joined, such as a fishing net, and was given to an article of ladies' clothing which consisted of a square of cloth
tied from the back over each shoulder and under each arm, with a knot on the breast.



certainty. If you are negligent you will miss the timing. Research this well.

To Hold Down a Shadow

"Holding down a shadow" is used when you can see the enemy's attacking spirit.

In large-scale strategy, when the enemy embarks on an attack, if you make a
show of strongly suppressing his technique, he will change his mind. Then, altering your
spirit, defeat him by forestalling him with a Void spirit.

Or, in single combat, hold down the enemy's strong intention with a suitable timing,
and defeat him by forestalling him with this timing. You must study this well.

To Pass On

Many things are said to be passed on. Sleepiness can be passed on, and yawning can be
passed on. Time can be passed on also.

In large-scale strategy, when the enemy is agitated and shows an inclination to
rush, do not mind in the least. Make a show of complete calmness, and the enemy will be
taken by this and will become relaxed. When you see that this spirit has been passed on,
you can bring about the enemy's defeat by attacking strongly with a Void spirit.

In single combat, you can win by relaxing your body and spirit and then, catching
on the moment the enemy relaxes, attack strongly and quickly, forestalling him.

What is known as "getting someone drunk" is similar to this. You can also infect
the enemy with a bored, careless, or weak spirit. You must study this well.

To Cause Loss of Balance

Many things can cause a loss of balance. One cause is danger, another is hardship, and
another is surprise. You must research this.

In large-scale strategy it is important to cause loss of balance. Attack without
warning where the enemy is not expecting it, and while his spirit is undecided follow up
your advantage and, having the lead, defeat him.

Or, in single combat, start by making a show of being slow, then suddenly attack
strongly. Without allowing him space for breath to recover from the fluctuation of spirit, you
must grasp the opportunity to win. Get the feel of this.

To Frighten

Fright often occurs, caused by the unexpected.

In large-scale strategy you can frighten the enemy not by what you present to their
eyes, but by shouting, making a small force seem large, or by threatening them from the
flank without warning. These things all frighten. You can win by making best use of the
enemy's frightened rhythm.

In single combat, also, you must use the advantage of taking the enemy unawares
by frightening him with your body, long sword, or voice, to defeat him. You should
research this well.



To Soak In

When you have come to grips and are striving together with the enemy, and you realise
that you cannot advance, you "soak in" and become one with the enemy. You can win by
applying a suitable technique while you are mutually entangled.

In battles involving large numbers as well as in fights with small numbers, you can
often win decisively with the advantage of knowing how to "soak" into the enemy,
whereas, were you to draw apart, you would lose the chance to win. Research this well.



To Injure the Corners

It is difficult to move strong things by pushing directly, so you should "injure the corners".

In large-scale strategy, it is beneficial to strike at the corners of the enemy's force.
If the corners are overthrown, the spirit of the whole body will be overthrown. To defeat
the enemy you must follow up the attack when the corners have fallen.

In single combat, it is easy to win once the enemy collapses. This happens when
you injure the "corners" of his body, and this weaken him. It is important to know how to
do this, so you must research this deeply.



To Throw into Confusion

This means making the enemy lose resolve.

In large-scale strategy we can use your troops to confuse the enemy on the field.
Observing the enemy's spirit, we can make him think, "Here? There? Like that? Like this?
Slow? Fast?" Victory is certain when the enemy is caught up in a rhythm that confuses his
spirit.

In single combat, we can confuse the enemy by attacking with varied techniques
when the chance arises. Feint a thrust or cut, or make the enemy think you are going
close to him, and when he is confused you can easily win.

This is the essence of fighting, and you must research it deeply.



The Three Shouts

The three shouts are divided thus: before, during and after. Shout according to the
situation. The voice is a thing of life. We shout against fires and so on, against the wind
and the waves. The voice shows energy.

In large-scale strategy, at the start of battle we shout as loudly as possible. During
the fight, the voice is low-pitched, shouting out as we attack. After the contest, we shout in
the wake of our victory. These are the three shouts.

In single combat, we make as if to cut and shout "Ei!" at the same time to disturb
the enemy, then in the wake of our shout we cut with the long sword. We shout after we
have cut down the enemy � this is to announce victory. This is called "sen go no koe"
(before and after voice). We do not shout simultaneously with flourishing the long sword.
We shout during the fight to get into rhythm. Research this deeply.



To Mingle



In battles, when the armies are in confrontation, attack the enemy's strong points and,
when you see that they are beaten back, quickly separate and attack yet another strong
point on the periphery of his force. The spirit of this is like a winding mountain path.

This is an important fighting method for one man against many. Strike down the
enemies in one quarter, or drive them back, then grasp the timing and attack further
strong points to right and left, as if on a winding mountain path, weighing up the enemies'
disposition. When you know the enemies' level, attack strongly with no trace of retreating
spirit.

In single combat, too, use this spirit with the enemy's strong points.

What is meant by 'mingling' is the spirit of advancing and becoming engaged with
the enemy, and not withdrawing even one step. You must understand this.



To Crush

This means to crush the enemy regarding him as being weak.

In large-scale strategy, when we see that the enemy has few men, or if he has
many men but his spirit is weak and disordered, we knock the hat over his eyes, crushing
him utterly. If we crush lightly, he may recover. You must learn the spirit of crushing as if
with a hand-grip.

In single combat, if the enemy is less skilful than yourself, if his rhythm is
disorganized, or if he has fallen into evasive or retreating attitudes, we must crush him
straightaway, with no concern for his presence and without allowing him space for breath.
It is essential to crush him all at once. The primary thing is not to let him recover his
position even a little. You must research this deeply.



The Mountain-Sea Change

The "mountain-sea" spirit means that it is bad to repeat the same thing several times
when fighting the enemy. There may be no help but to do something twice, but do not try it
a third time. If you once make an attack and fail, there is little chance of success if you use
the same approach again. If you attempt a technique which you have previously tried
unsucessfully and fail yet again, then you must change your attacking method.

If the enemy thinks of the mountains, attack like the sea; and if he thinks of the
sea, attack like the mountains. You must research this deeply.



To Penetrate the Depths

When we are fighting with the enemy, even when it can be seen that we can win on the
surface with the benefit of the Way, if his spirit is not extinguished, he may be beaten
superficially yet undefeated in spirit deep inside. With this principle of "penetrating the
depths" we can destroy the enemy's spirit in its depths, demoralising him by quickly
changing our spirit. This often occurs.

Penetrating the depths means penetrating with the long sword, penetrating with
the body, and penetrating with the spirit. This cannot be understood in a generalisation.

Once we have crushed the enemy in the depths, there is no need to remain
spirited. But otherwise we must remain spirited. If the enemy remains spirited it is difficult
to crush him. You must train in penetrating the depths for large-scale strategy and also
single combat.



To Renew

"To renew" applies when we are fighting with the enemy, and an entangled spirit arises
where there is no possible resolution. We must abandon our efforts, think of the situation
in a fresh spirit then win in the new rhythm. To renew, when we are deadlocked with the
enemy, means that without changing our circumstance we change our spirit and win
through a different technique.

It is necessary to consider how "to renew" also applies in large-scale strategy.
Research this diligently.



Rat's Head, Ox's Neck

"Rat's head and ox's neck" means that, when we are fighting with the enemy and both he
and we have become occupied with small points in an entangled spirit, we must always
think of the Way of strategy as being both a rat's head and an ox's neck. Whenever we
have become preoccupied with small details, we must suddenly change into a large spirit,
interchanging large with small.

This is one of the essences of strategy. It is necessary that the warrior think in this
spirit in everyday life. You must not depart from this spirit in large-scale strategy nor in
single combat.



The Commander Knows the Troops

"The commander knows the troops" applies everywhere in fights in my Way of strategy.

Using the wisdom of strategy, think of the enemy as your own troops. When you
think in this way you can move him at will and be able to chase him around. You become
the general and the enemy becomes your troops. You must master this.



To Let Go the Hilt

There are various kinds of spirit involved in letting go the hilt.

There is the spirit of winning without a sword. There is also the spirit of holding the
long sword but not winning. The various methods cannot be expressed in writing. You
must train well.



The Body of a Rock ^^

When you have mastered the Way of strategy you can suddenly make your body like a
rock, and ten thousand things cannot touch you. This is the body of a rock.

You will not be moved. Oral tradition.

What is recorded above is what has been constantly on my mind about Ichi school
sword fencing, written down as it came to me. This is the first time I have written about my



51 The body of tfie rock: This is recorded in the Terao Ka Ki, the chronicle of the house of Terao. Once, a lord asked
Musashi "What is this 'Body of a rock'?" Musashi replied, "Please summon my pupil Terao Ryuma Suke". When Terao
appeared, Musashi ordered him to kill himself by cutting his abdomen. Just as Terao was about to make the cut, Musashi
restrained him and said to the lord, "This is the 'Body of the Rock'".



technique, and the order of things is a bit confused. It is difficult to express it clearly.

This book is a spiritual guide for the man who wishes to learn the Way.

My heart has been inclined to the Way of strategy from my youth onwards. I have
devoted myself to training my hand, tempering my body, and attaining the many spiritual
attitudes of sword fencing. If we watch men of other schools discussing theory, and
concentrating on techniques with the hands, even though they seem skilful to watch, they
have not the slightest true spirit.

Of course, men who study in this way think they are training the body and spirit,
but it is an obstacle to the true Way, and its bad influence remains for ever. Thus the true
Way of strategy is becoming decadent and dying out.

The true Way of sword fencing is the craft of defeating the enemy in a fight, and
nothing other than this. If you attain and adhere to the wisdom of my strategy, you need
never doubt that you will win.



The second year of Shoho, the fifth month, the twelfth day (1645)

Teruo Magonojo SHINMEN MUSASHI



The Wind Book



In strategy you must know the Ways of other schools, so I have written about various
other traditions of strategy in this the Wind Book.

Without knowledge of the Ways of other schools, it is difficult to understand the
essence of my Ichi school. Looking at other schools we find some that specialise in
techniques of strength using extra-long swords. Some schools study the Way of the short
sword, known as kodachi. Some schools teach dexterity in large numbers of sword
techniques, teaching attitudes of the sword as the "surface" and the Way as the "interior".

That none of these are the true Way I show clearly in the interior of this book � all
the vices and virtues and rights and wrongs. My Ichi school is different. Other schools
make accomplishments their means of livelihood, growing flowers and decoratively
colouring articles in order to sell them. This is definately not the Way of strategy.

Some of the world's strategists are concerned only with sword fencing, and limit
their training to flourishing the long sword and carriage of the body. But is dexterity alone
sufficient to win? This is not the essence of the Way.

I have recorded the unsatisfactory points of other schools one by one in this book.
You must study these matters deeply to appreciate the benefit of my Ni To Ichi school.



Other Schools Using Extra-Long Swords

Some other schools have a liking for extra-long swords. From the point of view of my
strategy these must be seen as weak schools. This is because they do not appreciate the
principle of cutting the enemy by any means. Their preference is for the extra-long sword
and, relying on the virtue of its length, they think to defeat the enemy from a distance.

In this world it is said, "One inch gives the hand advantage", but these are the idle
words of one who does not know strategy. It shows the inferior strategy of a weak sprit
that men should be dependant on the length of their sword, fighting from a distance
without the benefit of strategy.

I expect there is a case for the school in question liking extra-long swords as part
of it's doctrine, but if we compare this with real life it is unreasonable. Surely we need not
necessarily be defeated if we are using a short sword, and have no long sword?

It is difficult for these people to cut the enemy when at close quarters because of
the length of the long sword. The blade path is large so the long sword is an
encumbrance, and they are at a disadvantage compared to the man armed with a short
companion sword.

From olden times it has been said: "Great and small go together." So do not
unconditionally dislike extra-long swords. What I dislike is the inclination towards the long
sword. If we consider large-scale strategy, we can think of large forces in terms of long
swords, and small forces as short swords. Cannot few men give battle against many?



There are many instances of few men overcoming many.

Your strategy is of no account if when called on to fight in a confined space your
heart is inclined to the long sword, or if you are in a house armed only with your
companion sword. Besides, some men have not the strength of others.

In my doctrine, I dislike preconceived, narrow spirit. You must study this well.



The Strong Long Sword Spirit in Other Schools

You should not speak of strong and weak long swords. If you just wield the long sword in
a strong spirit your cutting will become coarse, and if you use the sword coarsely you will
have difficulty in winning.

If you are concerned with the strength of your sword, you will try to cut
unreasonably strongly, and will not be able to cut at all. It is also bad to try to cut strongly
when testing the sword. Whenever you cross swords with an enemy you must not think of
cutting him either strongly or weakly; just think of cutting and killing him. Be intent solely
on killing the enemy. Do not try to cut strongly and, of course, do not think of cutting
weakly. You should only be concerned with killing the enemy.

If you rely on strength, when you hit the enemy's sword you will inevitably hit too
hard. If you do this, your own sword will be carried along as a result. Thus the saying,
"The strongest hand wins", has no meaning.

In large-scale strategy, if you have a strong army and are relying on strength to
win, but the enemy also has a strong army, the battle will be fierce. This is the same for
both sides.

Without the correct principle the fight cannot be won.

The spirit of my school is to win through the wisdom of strategy, paying no
attention to trifles. Study this well.



Use of the Shorter Long Sword in Other Schools

Using a shorter long sword is not the true Way to win.

In ancient times, tachi and katana meant long and short swords. Men of superior
strength in the world can wield even a long sword lightly, so there is no case for their liking
the short sword. They also make use of the length of spears and halberds. Some men use
a shorter long sword with the intention of jumping in and stabbing the enemy at the
unguarded moment when he flourishes his sword. This inclination is bad.

To aim for the enemy's unguarded moment is completely defensive, and
undesirable at close quarters with the enemy. Furthermore, you cannot use the method of
jumping inside his defense with a short sword if there are many enemies. Some men think
that if they go against many enemies with a shorter long sword they can unrestrictedly
frisk around cutting in sweeps, but they have to parry cuts continuously, and eventually
become entangled with the enemy. This is inconsistant with the true Way of strategy.

The sure Way to win thus is to chase the enemy around in a confusing manner,
causing him to jump aside, with your body held strongly and straight. The same principle
applies to large-scale strategy. The essence of strategy is to fall upon the enemy in large
numbers and to bring about his speedy downfall. By their study of strategy, people of the
world get used to countering, evading and retreating as the normal thing. They become
set in this habit, so can easily be paraded around by the enemy. The Way of strategy is
straight and true. You must chase the enemy around and make him obey your spirit.



Other Schools with many Methods of using the Long Sword

I think it is lield in otiier scliools tliat there are many methods of using the long sword in
order to gain the admiration of beginners. This is selling the Way. It is a vile spirit in
strategy.

The reason for this is that to deliberate over many ways of cutting down a man is
an error. To start with, killing is not the Way of mankind. Killing is the same for people who
know about fighting and for those who do not. It is the same for women or children, and
there are not many different methods. We can speak of different tactics such as stabbing
and mowing down, but none other than these.

Anyway, cutting down the enemy is the Way of strategy, and there is no need for
many refinements of it.

Even so, according to the place, your long sword may be obstructed above or to
the sides, so you will need to hold your sword in such manner that it can be used. There
are five methods in five directions.

Methods apart from these five � hand twisting, body bending, jumping out, and so
on, to cut the enemy � are not the true Way of strategy. In order to cut the enemy you
must not make twisting or bending cuts. This is completely useless. In my strategy, I bear
my spirit and body straight, and cause the enemy to twist and bend. The necessary spirit
is to win by attacking the enemy when his spirit is warped. You must study this well.



Use of Attitudes of the Long Sword in Other Schools

Placing a great deal of importance on the attitudes of the long sword is a mistaken way of
thinking. What is known in the world as "attitude" applies when there is no enemy. The
reason is that this has been a precedent since ancient times, that there should be no such
thing as "This is the modern way to do it" duelling. You must force the enemy into
inconvenient situations.

Attitudes are for situations in which you are not to be moved. That is, for
garrisoning castles, battle array, and so on, showing the spirit of not being moved even by
a strong assault. In the Way of duelling, however, you must always be intent upon taking
the lead and attacking. Attitude is the spirit of awaiting an attack. You must appreciate
this.

In duels of strategy you must move the opponent's attitude. Attack where his spirit
is lax, throw him into confusion, irritate and terrify him. Take advantage of the enemy's
rhythm when he is unsettled and you can win.

I dislike the defensive spirit known as "attitude". Therefore, in my Way, there is
something called "Attitude-No Attitude".

In large-scale strategy we deploy our troops for battle bearing in mind our strength,
observing the enemy's numbers, and noting the details of the battlefield. This is at the
start of the battle.

The spirit of attacking is completely different from the spirit of being attacked.
Bearing an attack well, with a strong attitude, and parrying the enemy's attack well, is like
making a wall of spears and halberds. When you attack the enemy, your spirit must go to
the extent of pulling the stakes out of a wall and using them as spears and halberds. You
must examine this well.



Fixing the Eyes in Other Schools



Some schools maintain that the eyes should be fixed on the enemy's long sword. Some
schools fix the eye on the hands. Some fix the eyes on the face, and some fix the eyes on
the feet, and so on. If you fix the eyes on these places your spirit can become confused,
and your strategy thwarted.

I will explain this in detail. Footballers^^ do not fix their eyes on the ball, but by
good play on the field they can perform well. When you become accustomed to
something, you are not limited to the use of your eyes. People such as master musicians
have the music score in front of their nose, or flourish the sword in several ways when
they have mastered the Way, but this does not mean that they fix their eyes on these
things specifically, or that they make pointless movements of the sword. It means that
they can see naturally.

In the Way of strategy, when you have fought many times you will easily be able to
appraise the speed and position of the enemy's sword, and having mastery of the Way
you will see the weight of his spirit. In strategy, fixing the eyes means gazing at the man's
heart.

In large-scale strategy the area to watch is the enemy's strength. "Perception" and
"sight" are the two methods of seeing. Perception consists of concentrating strongly on
the enemy's spirit, observing the condition of the battle field, fixing the gaze strongly,
seeing the progress of the fight and the changes of advantage. This is the sure way to
win.

In single combat you must not fix the eyes on details. As I said before, if you fix
your eyes on details and neglect important things, your spirit will become bewildered, and
victory will escape you. Research this principle well and train diligently.



Use of the Feet in Other Schools

There are various methods of using the feet: floating foot, jumping foot, springing foot,
treading foot, crow's foot, and such nible walking methods. From the point of view of my
strategy, these are all unsatisfactory.

I dislike floating foot because the feet always tend to float during the fight. The
Way must be trod firmly.

Neither do I like jumping foot, because it encourages the habit of jumping, and a
jumpy spirit. However much you jump, there is no real justification for it, so jumping is bad.

Springing foot causes a springing spirit which is indecisive.

Treading foot is a "waiting" method, and I especially dislike it.

Apart from these, there are various fast walking methods, such as crow's foot, and
so on.

Sometimes, however, you may encounter the enemy on marshland, swampy
ground, river valleys, stony ground, or narrow roads, in which situations you cannot jump
or move the feet quickly.

In my strategy, the footwork does not change. I always walk as I usually do in the
street. You must never lose control of your feet. According to the enemy's rhythm, move
fast or slowly, adjusting your body not too much and not too little.

Carrying the feet is important also in large-scale strategy. This is because, if you
attack quickly and thoughtlessly without knowing the enemy's spirit, your rhythm will
become deranged and you will not be able to win. Or, if you advance too slowly, you will
not be able to take advantage of the enemy's disorder, the opportunity to win will escape,
and you will not be able to finish the fight quickly. You must win by seizing upon the



52 Footballers: Football was a court game in ancient Japan. There is a reference to it in Genji Monogatari.



enemy's disorder and derangement, and by not according him even a little hope of
recovery. Practise this well.



Speed in Other Schools

Speed is not part of the true Way of strategy. Speed implies that things seem fast or slow,
according to whether or not they are in rhythm. Whatever the Way, the master of strategy
does not appear fast.

Some people can walk as fast as a hundred or a hundred and twenty miles in a
day, but this does not mean that they run continuously from morning till night. Unpractised
runners may seem to have been running all day, but their performance is poor.

In the Way of dance, accomplished performers can sing while dancing, but when
beginners try this they slow down and their spirit becomes busy. The "old pine tree"^^
melody beaten on a leather drum is tranquil, but when beginners try this they slow down
and their spirit becomes busy. Very skilful people can manage a fast rhythm, but it is bad
to beat hurredly. If you try to beat too quickly you will get out of time. Of course, slowness
is bad. Really skilful people never get out of time, and are always deliberate, and never
appear busy. From this example, the principle can be seen.

What is known as speed is especially bad in the Way of strategy. The reason for
this is that depending on the place, marsh or swamp and so on, it may not be possible to
move the body and legs together quickly. Still less will you be able to cut quickly if you
have a long sword in this situation. If you try to cut quickly, as if using a fan or short sword,
you will not actually cut even a little. You must appreciate this.

In large-scale strategy also, a fast busy spirit is undesirable. The spirit must be that
of holding down a pillow, then you will not be even a little late.

When you opponent is hurrying recklessly, you must act contrarily, and keep calm.
You must not be influenced by the opponent. Train diligently to attain this spirit.



"Interior" and "Surface" in Other Schools

There is no "interior" nor "surface" in strategy.

The artistic accomplishments usually claim inner meaning and secret tradition, and
"interior" and "gate","' but in combat there is no such thing as fighting on the surface, or
cutting with the interior. When I teach my Way, I first teach by training in techniques which
are easy for the pupil to understand, a doctrine which is easy to understand. I gradually
endeavour to explain the deep principle, points which it is hardly possible to comprehend,
according to the pupil's progress. In any event, because the way to understanding is
through experience, I do not speak of "interior" and "gate".

In this world, if you go into the mountains, and decide to go deeper and yet
deeper, instead you will emerge at the gate. Whatever is the Way, it has an interior, and it
is sometimes a good thing to point out the gate. In strategy, we cannot say what is
concealed and what is revealed.

Accordingly I dislike passing on my Way through written pledges and regulations.
Perceiving the ability of my pupils, I teach the direct Way, remove the bad influence of
other schools, and gradually introduce them to the true Way of the warrior.

s'' Gate: A student enrolling in a school would pass through the gate of the Dojo. To enter a teacher's gate means to take

up a course of study.



The method of teaching my strategy is with a trustworthy spirit. You must train
diligently.

I have tried to record an outline of the strategy of other schools in the above nine sections.
I could now continue by giving a specific account of these schools one by one, from the
"gate" to the "interior", but I have intentionally not named the schools or their main points.
The reason for this is that different branches of schools give different interpretations of the
doctrines. In as much as men's opinions differ, so there must be differing ideas on the
same matter. Thus no one man's conception is valid for any school.

I have shown the general tendencies of other schools on nine points. If we look at
them from an honest viewpoint, we see that people always tend to like long swords or
short swords, and become concerned with strength in both large and small matters. You
can see why I do not deal with the "gates" of other schools.

In my Ichi school of the long sword there is neither gate nor interior. There is no
inner meaning in sword attitudes. You must simply keep your spirit true to realise the
virtue of strategy.

The Book of the Void

The Ni To Ichi Way of strategy is recorded in this the Book of the Void.

What is called the spirit of the void is where there is nothing. It is not included in
man's knowledge. Of course the void is nothingness. By knowing things that exist, you
can know that which does not exist. That is the void.

People in this world look at things mistakenly, and think that what they do not
understand must be the void. This is not the true void. It is bewilderment.

In the Way of strategy, also, those who study as warriors think that whatever they
cannot understand in their craft is the void. This is not the true void.

To attain the Way of strategy as a warrior you must study fully other martial arts
and not deviate even a little from the Way of the warrior. With your spirit settled,
accumulate practice day by day, and hour by hour. Polish the twofold spirit heart and
mind, and sharpen the twofold gaze perception and sight. When your spirit is not in the
least clouded, when the clouds of bewilderment clear away, there is the true void.

Until you realise the true Way, whether in Buddhism or in common sense, you may
think that things are correct and in order. However, if we look at things objectively, from
the viewpoint of laws of the world, we see various doctrines departing from the true Way.
Know well this spirit, and with forthrightness as the foundation and the true spirit as the
Way. Enact strategy broadly, correctly and openly.

Then you will come to think of things in a wide sense and, taking the void as the
Way, you will see the Way as void.

In the void is virtue, and no evil. Wisdom has existence, principle has existence,
the Way has existence, spirit is nothingness.
